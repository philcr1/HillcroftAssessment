## Features
This laravel project:
- Allows the user to select an XML product file, and enter their email address
- Allows the import of product data (I have provided XML files with working data, broken data, 1000 products, and 25000 products)
- Sends an email for out of stock notifications to the users provided email
- Displays a list of all imported product data

I developed this in Visual Studio Code
For the email, I have used the Mailpit plugin, which allows testing of emails.  This can be accessed on http://localhost:8025 when installed
